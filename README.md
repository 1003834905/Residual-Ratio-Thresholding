# Residual-Ratio-Thresholding
Residual Ratio Thresholding  (RRT) is a technique to identify the the correct regression model from a sequence of  nested models.  This has found applications in sparse linear regression aka compressed sensing and robust regression with sparse outliers.  RRT allows the operation of algorithms like LASSO, OMP and their derivatives without knowing signal sparsity and noise variance. RRT also provides easy to interpret final sample support recovery guarantees.  RRT is closely related to various information theoretic criteria. However, many of these information theoretic criteria, RRT is based on finite sample distributional results.
